# Tech debt

Known debt in the code and docs, with the proposed fix for each. Each file follows [rules/docs.md](../rules/docs.md#tech-debt). A debt doesn't block a roadmap step unless the step says so.

Add each new debt as a file, and list it in a table of File and Debt, in the order to work on them. A later debt can depend on an earlier one, as its file says.

| File | Debt |
| --- | --- |
| [comment-rule-workarounds.md](comment-rule-workarounds.md) | The header rule ends at the first blank line, so a long block after one passes lint |
